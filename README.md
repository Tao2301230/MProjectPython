# Project Title

SparkTuner

## Getting Started

These instructions will get you a copy of the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. See deployment for notes on how to deploy the project on a live system.

### Prerequisites

This project is mainly built with the support of OpenTuner. The included OpenTuner zip file, opentuner.tar.gz, is the modified version of OpenTuner. Main modified proportion is the code generation logs and result. Please follow the instruction of http://opentuner.org/tutorial/setup/ to set up the environment. The reference location is defined in adddeps.py, to help the GUI to locate the position of OpenTuner.

### Other Requirements

* [python 2.7](https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-2712/) - The programming language arparse package.
* [Tkinter 8.6](https://www.tcl.tk/software/tcltk/8.6.html) - Graphical package
* [SQLite 3.11.0](https://www.sqlite.org/releaselog/3_11_0.html) - Database


## Main Components

Main functions are in files: MFrameUI.py, RuntimeSummary.py and SparkTuner.py.

Main GUI is in the MFrameGUI.py. This includes all the GUI components and their linked events. The main function of this file is to accept user inputs, update the global variable and build up the bridge between GUI and processing modules:  sparktuner.py and RuntimeSummary.py.

Global variables are defined in a separated file: gl.py. Variables are defined in the form of dict and list in the file and processed each module. 

SparkTuner.py is the script which communicates with the OpenTuner directly. SparkTuner.py reads the parameters in gl.py and transforms it into commands to submit to OpenTuner. The default tuning program is mmm_block.cpp. The compile is tmp.bin. Tuning result is stored in cc_param_defaults.json. Tuning log is stored in opentuner.log.

RuntimeSummary.py    is the file which provides the function to analyse the logs and generate plots. The input of this file is the log generated by OpenTuner. The summary will be stored in the gl.py and image will be saved to the directory of './img/'.
